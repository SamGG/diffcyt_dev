\title{Create design matrix}
\usage{
createDesignMatrix(experiment_info, cols_design = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{experiment_info}{\code{data.frame}, \code{DataFrame}, or \code{tbl_df} of
experiment information (which was also previously provided to
\code{\link{prepareData}}). This should be a data frame containing all factors and
covariates of interest; e.g. group IDs, block IDs, batch IDs, and continuous
covariates.}

\item{cols_design}{(Logical) Columns of \code{experiment_info} to include in the design
matrix. Default = all columns.}
}
\value{
\code{design}: Returns a design matrix (numeric matrix), with one row per
  sample, and one column per model parameter.
}
\description{
Create design matrix for model fitting
}
\details{
Creates a design matrix specifying the models to be fitted. (Alternatively,
\code{\link{createFormula}} can be used to generate a model formula instead of a design
matrix.)

The design matrix can then be provided to the differential testing functions, together
with the data object and contrast matrix.

The \code{experiment_info} input (which was also previously provided to
\code{\link{prepareData}}) should be a data frame containing all factors and covariates
of interest. For example, depending on the experimental design, this may include the
following columns:

\itemize{
\item group IDs (e.g. groups for differential testing)
\item block IDs (e.g. patient IDs in a paired design)
\item batch IDs (batch effects)
\item continuous covariates
}

The logical vector \code{cols_design} specifies which columns in \code{experiment_info}
to include in the design matrix. (For example, there may be an additional column of
sample IDs, which should not be included.)

Columns of indicator variables (e.g. group IDs, block IDs, and batch IDs) must be
formatted as factors (otherwise they will be treated as numeric values). The indicator
columns will be expanded into the design matrix format. The names for each parameter
are taken from the column names of \code{experiment_info}.

All factors provided here will be included as fixed effect terms in the design matrix.
Alternatively, to use random effects for some factors (e.g. for block IDs), see
\code{\link{createFormula}}; or, depending on the method used, provide them directly to
the differential testing function (\code{\link{testDA_voom}} and
\code{\link{testDS_limma}}).

# For a complete workflow example demonstrating each step in the 'diffcyt' pipeline, 
# see the package vignette.

# Example: simple design matrix
experiment_info <- data.frame(
  sample_id = factor(paste0("sample", 1:4)), 
  group_id = factor(c("group1", "group1", "group2", "group2")), 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
createDesignMatrix(experiment_info, cols_design = 2)

# Example: more complex design matrix: patient IDs and batch IDs
experiment_info <- data.frame(
  sample_id = factor(paste0("sample", 1:8)), 
  group_id = factor(rep(paste0("group", 1:2), each = 4)), 
  patient_id = factor(rep(paste0("patient", 1:4), 2)), 
  batch_id = factor(rep(paste0("batch", 1:2), 4)), 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
createDesignMatrix(experiment_info, cols_design = 2:4)

# Example: more complex design matrix: continuous covariate
experiment_info <- data.frame(
  sample_id = factor(paste0("sample", 1:4)), 
  group_id = factor(c("group1", "group1", "group2", "group2")), 
  age = c(52, 35, 71, 60), 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
